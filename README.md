# Biodiversity.js

A project using JS, HTML, Plotly and Flask to build an interactive dashboard about bacteria.

In this project I create an interactive dashboard to explore Biodiversity dataset about belly buttons, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset shows that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in over 70% of the people tested, however others were more rare.
