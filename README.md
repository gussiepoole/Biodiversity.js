# Biodiversity.js

## Project Overview
In this project I create an interactive dashboard to explore Biodiversity dataset about belly buttons, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Analysis
The dataset shows that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in over 70% of the people tested, however others were more rare. 


This interactive dashboard was made with: JavaScript, HTML, Plotly and Flask
